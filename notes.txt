Node.js is a javascript runtime environment which helps in using javascript outside the browsers.

NPM is used to install packages permanently in the system while NPX is used to install them temporarily.
When we generate react app with create-react-app, we use NPX as we want to do it only once in the start.

Thunder Client - it is an alternative to postman (can be used to check APIs)

export "something" should be imported with the same name unless used export default

anything can be passed as props from App.js to the component it is callling in a way like html tag.

PROPS
props are some arguement we send to a component for getting something specfic at some place in the component.
This way we can use same component with different values.
propTypes - can be used to define the type of prop in a component. If the recieved props are not of the same type it shows warning.
defaultprops - not working here, instead just mention the prop in the parameters of the component with the default value(like we do it in python)


npm run build converts the whole project into a static project which is a production ready build.
